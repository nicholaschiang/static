  Inspired by the 1987 movie that was the basis of our very first collection —
  “White Mischief”. A breathtakingly beautiful story of British expats in
  Nairobi in the early 1940’s; the tagline was “In England, they were the elite,
  but bound by rules of society. In Kenya there were no rules, only glamour,
  decadence… and murder.”

  Some prints are evocative of African mud cloth, but glazed in pailettes. The
  colors are Saharan — sand, coffee, ebony, cumin, lemon, kiwi and turquoise.
  Other prints are taken from Aboriginal woodcuts and tribal impressions of
  schools of fish.
