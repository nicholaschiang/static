  Nobody is like <strong>Hermes</strong> . A centenary luxury that continues to
  renew itself without forgetting its values. The
  <strong>men's Spring Summer 2023 collection</strong> presented in Paris during
  Paris Fashion Week at the <span>Manufacture des Gobelins</span> and which the
  <strong>creative director Véronique Nichanian</strong> defines as "
  <em>innovatively fascinating</em> ", is extremely summery and above all,
  innovative: the masculine stylistic codes are deconstructed and rewritten,
  <strong>colored with lilac</strong> , apricot and raspberry and decorated with
  hyper cool and fun patterns, such as seahorses and shrimps.

  SS23 is <strong>extremely sunny and playful</strong> , a collection that mixes
  classic and minimal pieces with riskier new garments for the Hermès wardrobe.
  Those who are fond of tradition should not despair, each garment is
  exceptional and recognizable (and how could it be the other way around? Hermès
  iconography is unique) despite being a collection dedicated to
  experimentation: the key to understanding SS23 is to grasp the delicate
  collision of the

  with that of the most formal archetypes. The classic symbols of the Maison
  then, are proposed through Pegasus reliefs and patches on informal and casual
  jackets, combined with mid-calf shorts with wide legs.

  The gems of the Spring Summer 2023 men's collection are certainly the lilac
  crocodile jacket and the men's Birkins (which needs no introduction; it's
  always her, with her eternal elegance and ethereal classicism). The shoes of
  the summer? Canvas-edged neoprene sandals and hyper-colored trainers, an
  essential and unorthodox resource for any occasion.
