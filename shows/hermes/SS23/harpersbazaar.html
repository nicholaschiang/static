  Held at <strong>Manufacture des Gobelins</strong> this past weekend, the
  <strong>Hermès</strong> spring/summer 2023 men’s collection is a masterclass
  in refined summer dressing. It’s all about rediscovering the joys of being
  together with loved ones, while enjoying the midsummer breeze. This sense of
  lightness also underlines the 53 looks that make up this collection, rendered
  in pastel shades and neutrals.

  Creative director <strong>Véronique Nichanian</strong> once again reminds the
  world why Hermès is globally revered for its expert craftsmanship. Apart from
  extremely wearable separates in fabrics that sway in the wind, the collection
  also comprises garments such as straight blousons in full-grain suede
  calfskin; overshirts in Herbier perforated sporty calfskin; trousers with
  drawstring waist in plume nubuck calfskin; and hooded parkas in light
  technical satin.

  Elsewhere in the collection, expect large, collarless shirts in cotton and
  linen piqué, high-neck pullovers in cashmere with crayfish design and
  highly-desirable carrot-fit trousers that will surely be your new summer
  staple. And the Garden Party Voyage bags—in plain, striped or Hermès Pacific
  printed H canvas and Sombrero calfskin—are perhaps the most covetable
  accessories in the collection.
