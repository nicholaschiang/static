  Despite the chatter about the Hermès Men’s Spring-Summer 2023 show being a
  very literal homage to the season (suns and seahorses and beach critters
  adorning the clothing), or the lightness and accessibility of the
  ready-to-wear itself, what I saw last week in the presentation was best
  exemplified by the runway Haut À Courroies carried down the runway: a large
  bag, a seemingly-utilitarian man’s bag – a bag which, in fact, has become
  iconographic of women’s fashion – adorned with wavy, incongruent lines which
  also somehow did not distort the appearance of the bag but merely enhanced and
  delineated its dimensions.

  So too, looking over the menswear, I was struck by the colors – pink,
  lavender, aqua, and yellow – which are not typical of traditional men’s
  clothing and which further were presented in very appealing profiles and cuts.
  While atypical, the colors and shapes only enhanced the ready-to-wear,
  delineating function or adding a genuine visual appeal. The masculine has
  become feminine, or at the very least, extremely versatile; finally, it is a
  nod to fashion’s existential compatibility (or sometimes, notoriously, its
  incompatibility) with practicality and general appeal.

  In short, Hermès knows its customers, and it seems to have noticed that no
  longer do we stick to one department: many women buy from the men’s
  department, and vice-versa; further if one is to wear color at all, we are no
  longer tied to particular palettes (or bag, sizes, for that matter). The
  colors, while definitely visually eye-catching (please please please let these
  colors be translated to the leather goods!) didn’t seem costumey or out of
  place. The result was a men’s collection that further blurs the line between
  menswear and womenswear, with everyone clamoring for a little bit of both (as
  hopeful an expression of equality of the sexes if ever there was one).

<p>And with that, a few notes:</p>
<p>
  Bags were huge in the show, both literally and figuratively: the HACs (40cm?
  50cm?); a giant lime Bolide emblazoned with studs in the shape of a heart; a
  supersized Garden Party, apparently meant to carry the entire garden; and
  other totes, whether for the beach or travel, which appeared large enough to
  carry everything one would need (is this new dimension a glimpse of what’s to
  come for the women?).
</p>
<p>
  Accessories seemed minimal, but most of note were the woven leather belts
  reminiscent of preppy fashion, tied like we used to in the 80s with the end
  hanging down, and a further iteration of the Dad sandal in a neoprene summer
  version.
