  The living is easy at Hermès, which showed off a collection of summery gelato
  tones and radiated sunshine on an otherwise gray and drizzly Paris day.
</p>
<p>
  Véronique Nichanian said she wanted this collection to be “all about holiday —
  not the city. It’s about lightness and having fun, pop colors and the natural
  world.”

  The show, which took place outside, on the grounds of the historic tapestry
  factory Manufacture des Gobelins, was pure escapism for guests, many of whom
  were wearing hooded khaki raincoats that Hermès staffers distributed at the
  entrance to the show.

<p>
  By contrast, models were dressed for déjeuner at Hotel du Cap-Eden-Roc, or
  aperitivo hour at Villa d’Este. They wore sunshine yellow twin-sets, and
  marine-themed tops, including a short-sleeved cashmere sweater with a crayfish
  on the front, and a roomy white shirt with a big blue seahorse.

  Short, cotton jackets came with seaweed patterns and beachy-bright cotton
  canvas bags had a palm tree print and rope handles. Windbreakers, shiny
  lightweight parkas and bucket hats came in a rainbow of colors, including
  lilac, grapefruit and aqua.

  These weren’t so much for rainy days, but for the salty spray on the deck of a
  yacht as it cuts through the Mediterranean.
</p>

  Nichanian also set out to replicate the ripples of a swimming pool, with
  crinkly stripes on tailored jackets and the wobbly wave design on a roomy
  white turtleneck with a big beige sun on the front. Hopefully the real thing
  will return to Paris soon.
