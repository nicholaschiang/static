  There isn’t much Véronique Nichanian hasn’t turned her hand to during her
  thirty-plus years as creative director of Hermès Men, yet she still never
  ceases to amaze season on season.

  Amidst a plethora of marine-themed pieces (including a crayfish sweater and a
  shirt with a sea horse on it), cotton jackets, and a wide array of
  accessories, Hermès Spring/Summer 2023 was undoubtedly a lesson in colorful
  outerwear – on what was an overcast day in the French capital.

  Taking place at the iconic Manufacture des Gobelins, Hermès SS23 put a myriad
  of stand-out windbreakers, pullovers, and matching bucket hats center stage,
  each of which crafted with a material that could’ve been mistaken for
  heavy-duty PVC and decorated in a rainbow of vibrant hues.

  Outerwear came accompanied by a variety of lightweight jackets perfect for
  breezy summer lunches, too – something certainly in-keeping with Nichanian’s
  aim of designing a collection “all about holiday” and “lightness and having
  fun, pop colors and the natural world” – as well as shirting and lightweight
  cashmere pieces.

  Footwear also caught the eye as Hermès looked to be delivering updated takes
  on its Izmir Sandal with added strapping and saucier tones, as a new series of
  sneakers also arrived in droves of pleasing contrasting colors, like orange
  and brown, and blue and aqua.

  While Hermès’ Paris show may be remembered by many as another strong offering
  of elevated everyday wear off the continually impressive Nichanian conveyor
  belt, for us it will forever be a lesson in keeping dry, in style.
